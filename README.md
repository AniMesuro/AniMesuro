# About Me

Hello, I'm Mesuro, 👋 I'm from Brazil and I make free GameDev tools and also develop games.
I'm comfortable in Godot Engine and GDScript. I know only a **little** bit of Python and lua.

### Languages:
🇧🇷Portuguese C2 | 🇺🇸English B2 | 🇷🇺Russian A2

I make digital paintings as a hobby. I code as a hobby too.
